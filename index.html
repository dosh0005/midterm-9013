                <p>We want to explore. We’re curious people. Look back over history, people have put their lives at stake to go out and explore … We believe in what we’re doing. Now it’s time to go.</p>
                <p> Buy why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask why climb the highest mountain? </p>
                <p> As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man. </p>
                <p> There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning. </p>
                <p> The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.</p>

                <p>Problems look mighty small from 150 miles up.</p>
                <p> For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us. </p>
                <p> I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine </p>
                <p> If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon. </p>
                <p> Curious that we spend more time congratulating people who have succeeded than encouraging people who have not.</p>
